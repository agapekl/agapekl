# Hey, I'm Agape! 👋  

I’m a 15-year-old software developer from New York, USA. My name is pronounced *uh-gah-pay*.  

Over the years, I’ve collaborated with several companies and am now focused on my own venture, [Many Social](https://many.app) — a powerful software platform that simplifies social media management, enhances team collaboration, and drives impactful, data-informed marketing strategies.  

I’m deeply passionate about automation and believe it holds the key to unlocking a faster, more innovative future for humanity by streamlining everyday tasks.

When I’m not building software, you’ll find me:  
- Exploring the fascinating world of **quantum physics**, diving into concepts like superposition and entanglement.  
- Creating and scaling **bootstrapped companies**, solving real-world problems with sustainable, innovative solutions.
- I am too lazy to continue writing this in corporate talk so im gonna stop here lol
