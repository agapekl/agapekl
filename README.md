# Who is Agape Keleta?
I am a 15 year old software developer from New York, USA. I've worked with quite a few companies, and most recently my own [Many Social](https://many.app), A software solution that centralizes the management of all your social media accounts, streamlines team collaboration, and empowers impactful, data-driven marketing decisions. I have a passion for automation and firmly believe that by automating our daily tasks, we can drastically accelerate the pace of human evolution.

In my spare time, I enjoy delving into quantum physics and its fascinating theories, exploring concepts like superposition and entanglement. I also have a passion for creating and scaling bootstrapped companies, focusing on innovative solutions and sustainable growth strategies.
