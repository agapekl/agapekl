# Hey, I'm Agape! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 15-year-old software developer from New York, USA. My name is pronounced *uh-gah-pay*. Over the years, Iâ€™ve collaborated with several companies and am now focused on my own venture, [Many Social](https://many.app) â€” a powerful software platform that simplifies social media management, enhances team collaboration, and drives impactful, data-informed marketing strategies.

Iâ€™m deeply passionate about automation and believe it holds the key to unlocking a faster, more innovative future for humanity by streamlining everyday tasks.  

When Iâ€™m not building software, youâ€™ll find me exploring the fascinating world of quantum physics, diving into concepts like superposition and entanglement. I also love creating and scaling bootstrapped companies, channeling my energy into solving real-world problems with sustainable and innovative solutions.
